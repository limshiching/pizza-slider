# 🍕 Pizza Slider

An animated pizza showcase built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Framer Motion**.

This project explores radial navigation, motion-driven UI systems, and SVG arc-based interaction. The focus was on engineering a smooth, scalable animation architecture rather than building a static layout.

---

## ✨ Overview

The Pizza Slider is an interactive component that allows users to browse different pizzas through an arc-based navigation system.

Key goals of this project:

- Experiment with motion-driven UI
- Build custom geometry-based interaction logic
- Create smooth directional transitions
- Ensure responsiveness across screen sizes

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- React
- TypeScript
- Framer Motion
- SVG (`textPath`, arc geometry)
- CSS (responsive layout + fluid scaling)

---

## 🚀 Features

- Radial arc navigation with clickable segments
- Spring-animated indicator dot
- Direction-aware animations
- Dynamic background transitions
- SVG textPath label system
- Responsive scaling from mobile to large displays (2K+)

---

## 🧠 Implementation Highlights

- Custom arc geometry built using polar coordinate calculations
- Motion values synced with SVG positioning
- Interactive hit zones aligned to curved text labels
- Directional animation logic based on navigation flow
- Fluid sizing using modern CSS techniques

```

## 🎨 Inspiration & Credits

Design inspired by the pizza slider concept created by [@divyashrma18](https://github.com/divyashrma18/pizza-slider).

All visual assets (pizza and ingredient images) are sourced from the original creator’s project.  
All interaction logic, animation systems, layout structure, and implementation were independently developed in this project.

## 🚧 Future Improvements

- Add scroll-wheel and swipe navigation to improve interaction discoverability
- Refine responsive layout for mobile devices
- Reduce transition timing for faster perceived responsiveness
- Improve spatial balance and layout density
